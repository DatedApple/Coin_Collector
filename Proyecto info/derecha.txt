	<h2><b>The Law of Sines</b></h2>
	
Sine (sin X) and cosine (cos X) are functions that apply in every triangle. Looking out from a vertex with angle θ, sin(θ) is the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse, 
	while cos(θ) is the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse.

	The Law of Sines is the relationship between the sides and angles of non-right (oblique) triangles. It states that the ratio of the length of a side of a triangle to the sine of the angle opposite that side is the 
	same for all sides and angles in a given triangle. The law says:

<br><br>
<p> That in this ABC triangle: </p>

	With this, we can use them to know other sides lengths and angles. EXAMPLE:
<br>
	Given two angles and an included side, find the remaining angle and sides. This is an AAS
<br>
	<i>ΔABC with ∠A=30° ∠B=20° and a=45 m.</i>  
</p>

<p> 
	The third angle of the triangle is
<br>
	<i>∠C=180°−∠A−∠B = 180°−30°−20°=130°</i>
<br>
	That means that ∠C=130°
<br>
	Now we can get this by replacing in the main formula that:

	<h2> The Law of Cosines </h2> 
	In Trigonometry, the law of Cosines, also known as the Cosine Rule or Cosine Formula, basically 
	relates the length of the triangle to the cosines of one of its angles. It states that, if the length of 
	two sides and the angle between them is known for a triangle, then we can determine the length
 	of the third side. It is given by:
 
	<i>c² = a² + b² – 2ab cos a</i>
</p>

		Problem and Solution
	Let us understand the concept by solving one of the cosines law problems.
	Problem: A triangle ABC has sides <i>a=10cm, b=7cm and c=5cm</i>. Now, find its angle ‘x’.
	Solution:
	Consider the below triangle as triangle ABC, where,
	<i>a=10cm</i>
	<i>b=7cm</i>
	<i>c=5cm</i>

		Law of Cosine Problems
	By using cosines law,
	<i>a2 = b2 + c2 – 2bc cos(x)</i>
	Or
	<i>cos x = (b2 + c2 – a2)/2bc</i>
	Substituting the value of the sides of the triangle i.e a,b and c, we get
	<i>cos(x) = (72 + 52 – 102)/(2 × 7 × 5)</i>
	<i>cos(x)=(49 + 25 -100)/70</i>
	<i>cos(x)= -0.37</i>
	It is important to solve more problems based on cosines law formula by changing the values of sides a, b & c and cross-check the law of cosines calculator given above.
